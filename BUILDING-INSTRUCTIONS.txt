Building the Markup Plugin
==========================

First, just try building the thing in Xcode on a fresh checkout.  If that works,
congratulations, you don't need to do a thing!

If that doesn't work, it probably failed because we don't know where the
RWPluginUtilities.framework is.  That's a framework that's embedded inside
the RapidWeaver.app bundle.  You'll need to tell Xcode where to find it.  To
do that:

 * Go to your Xcode Preferences (Cmd-,).
 * Go to the "Source Trees" tab.
 * Add a new setting named RapidWeaverPath, and set its Path to where you've
   installed RapidWeaver, e.g. "/Applications/RapidWeaver 3.5.app" (you'll need
   double quotes around the path if it has a space or unusual characters in
   it.)
   
That should be about it.  Email me if you're still having problems building the
thing.
