Markup Plugin Changes
=====================


Version 0.16
------------

* Strip <p> and </p> markers from markup text unless it's actually at the
  start or end of a paragraph.

* Added Texy markup filter <http://texy.info/en/>.

Version 0.15
------------

* The mailto: link in the the Textile filter should work a little better now.
  (Thanks to Mirko Viviani for this patch.)

* Entering Markup text in a sidebar should now work a little better.  (Thanks
  to Roger Nilsson for this fix.)

* The 'U' suffix in the version number was dropped, since Universal Binaries
  are the norm now.

Version 0.14U
-------------

* Hovering your mouse over a markup text area will now display a tooltip
  telling you what kind of markup it is, e.g. Markdown or Textile.  (This
  applies to markup text that have been set with 0.14U and later only.)

* Smart Quotes are now on by default.
