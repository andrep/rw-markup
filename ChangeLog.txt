Markup Plugin Changes
=====================

Version 0.16
------------

* Strip <p> and </p> markers from markup text unless it's actually at the
  start or end of a paragraph.


Version 0.14U
-------------

* Hovering your mouse over a markup text area will now display a tooltip
  telling you what kind of markup it is, e.g. Markdown or Textile.  (This
  applies to markup text that have been set with 0.14U and later only.)

* Smart Quotes are now on by default.
